Using Deep Learning and Neural Network, develop a Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification.The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.
The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.
In order to estimate the performance of a model for a given training run, we can further split the training set into a train and validation dataset. Performance on the train and validation dataset over each run can then be plotted to provide learning curves and insight into how well a model is learning the problem.
